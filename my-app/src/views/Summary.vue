    <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:80px; color: orange">VUE AND VUETIFY</h1>
    
    <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:55px; color: orange">STRENGTHS</h1>

   
    <div class="center"> 
     
<p class="blocktext">Vuetify strengths are numerous notably one of the pivotal reason why one should use it is the fact that it is relatively easy to understand and the fact that its documentation is also quite clear and concise saves developers that are new to this framework a lot of precious time, keeping in mind that the latter must have a certain degree of knowledge in JavaScript and HTML. 
</p>
<p  class="blocktext" >Furthermore, unlike a lot of the JS frameworks, Vue.js offers a very simple integration as a lot of the web page’s components can be held within a considerably small pool of files. Hence making it a lot easier to reuse and modify components when working on new projects. The flexibility that a lot of people talk about when it comes to this framework, lies in the similarity in design to other very popular frameworks notably JS or React, which again makes it quite simple to pick up.

  </p>

  <p class="blocktext">Lastly is Vuetify’s very pleasing base layout, considerably easy for users to navigate and quite pleasing to the eye without necessarily being to overpowering . It is known for being the best choice when it comes to material design, it allows users to easily create designs that are both visually appealing as well as functional.The looks of a webpage can often be overlooked, but vuetify makes it hard to do so. 
    </p>


 <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:55px; color: orange">WEAKNESSES</h1>
 
 <p class="blocktext">One of the few weaknesses of this framework is that its community is quite small making creating a somewhat lackluster set of resources when compared to its more popular compatriots. The lack of quality documentation also makes it difficult for some developers to learn and work with, however vue’s popularity is growing, not without reason , so developpement in the resources area should be expected to arrive soon as Vuetify is in fact open source. Although the material design is one of the best, it lacks in terms of customization, it is often recommended to avoid vuetify if you require a custom design.
</p>


<p class="blocktext">
  Vue.js also has a language barrier as the creator is chinese-american, majority of users are non-english speaking users and most of the coding is written in chinese. This makes it difficult for only english speaking users to make use of the framework.

</p>


<h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:55px; color: orange">DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<p class="blocktext">
  The developers that use Vue.js are mostly front-end devs, likely to have an easy to navigate webpage, as mentioned before one of the strong points of this framework are its layout. Some of the companies that have used Vue.js are:
   <ul class="blocktext">
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>Netflix</li>
  <li>AliBaba</li>
  <li>Grammarly</li>
</ul>
   As one can see these are websites that have high traffic and all kinds of users ranging from tech savvy teens to people that are not too familiar with how to navigate a webpage.

  <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:80px; color: orange">LARAVEL</h1>

 <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:55px; color: orange">STRENGTHS</h1>

 <p class="blocktext">Laravel was used as single page application for this assignment and it excels at that. It is a simple and elegant framework that makes development relatively simple. Used in conjunction with its strong object oriented features it makes building a well structured backend a breeze.
 </p>

 <p class="blocktext">Furthermore, Laravel has built in security which is one less thing to worry about for developers that already have so much to keep in mind while coding. This really sets it apart from the other PHP frameworks that exist. Also the fact that Laravel is not dependent on third parties makes it relatively simple to maintain every so often.
 </p>

 <p class="blocktext">

Some developers also consider Laravel as one of the the more straight forwards and concise PHP frameworks. The fact that Laravel is built upon the newer versions of PHP makes it so one has to get that version for it to work but in doing so it capitalizes on the newer features available setting apart from backward compatible frameworks. These strong points make Laravel one of the better frameworks to use for newer web developers.

 </p>


  <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:55px; color: orange">WEAKNESSES</h1>


<p class="blocktext">Laravel was quite tedious and time consuming to install, conjunctively deploying Laravel applications also suffered from these same problems.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
  Additionally, the documentation for Laravel, though still better than none, was quite convoluted and hard to understand, when compared to something like Vuetify’s documentation.
  </p>
<p class="blocktext">
  Other than the previously mentioned weaknesses Laravel was quite smooth to use overall.
  </p>


  <h1 class="text-md-center" style="font-size:55px; color: orange">DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<p class="blocktext">
 Laravel is used mainly by web developers for the back end. Some of the websites that use it are:

<ul class="blocktext">
  <li>9GAG</li>
  <li>Sandisk</li>
  <li>Startups.co</li>
  <li>Fox47</li>
</ul>  

There are also many more websites as Laravel is easily one of the most used frameworks for high traffic web pages currently.
