        My experience with Vue and Vuetify was amazing! These frameworks are very simple yet effective.
        
       This framework was very easy to setup, and has excellent documentation that guides you along the way.
         I believe that Vuetify is the easiest framework to learn, because the documentation is very well made. 
       <br> <br> But my experience with Laravel was completely opposite. Laravel has a very steep learning curve. 
         I had to look at many sources outside the official Laravel documentation to setup Laravel. 
         I also found that Laraval has a steep learning curve compared to regular PHP. It took me a few days to understand the Laravel framework properly.

            If I were to make an application again, I think I would try to do the same thing but add more stuff on top of it.
            
            I believe that my website as of right now is very simple, and it can be improved upon.
            
            I do not regret my choice of framworks. I think that all three frameworks that I picked are very powerful
            
            and once I master these, I can create amazing full-stack applications.
